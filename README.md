Overview
This project is an advanced algorithmic trading bot designed to trade financial instruments using a combination of traditional technical analysis and modern machine learning techniques. The bot is capable of collecting historical and real-time market data, processing this data to generate trading signals, and executing trades in both a simulated and live environment.

Features
Market Data Collection: Collects historical and real-time data from financial markets using the Yahoo Finance API and Alpaca API.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the data, including the calculation of technical indicators like Moving Averages and RSI.
Machine Learning Integration: Incorporates AI models, such as Random Forest and LSTM, to predict market movements and enhance trading strategies.
Hybrid Trading Strategy: Combines signals from technical analysis with AI model predictions to make informed trading decisions.
Backtesting and Paper Trading: Tests the trading strategy on historical data and in a simulated environment to evaluate performance before going live.
Live Trading: Executes trades in a live environment with real-time monitoring and risk management features.
